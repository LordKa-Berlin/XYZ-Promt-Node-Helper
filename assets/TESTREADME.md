**Author**: LordKa-Berlin

## Overview

`ImagePromptViewer` is a Python-based tool to display and manage image files (PNG and JPEG) that have embedded **prompt data**—typically generated by **AI tools** such as **Stable Diffusion**, **AUTOMATIC1111**, or **Forge**.

It reads embedded text data (prompt, negative prompt, generation settings) and shows this information alongside each image. A fullscreen mode is included and supports prompt viewing, syntax highlighting for LoRAs and weights, and various filter options.

This is a **stable release** — tested, reliable, and ready for public use.

## Important Note about AI-Generated Prompts

If you have an **AI-generated image** whose prompt cannot yet be read by ImagePromptViewer, feel free to **send the image** along with **information about the tool or generator used** to:

ImagePromptViewer is still in its early development phase — more AI tools and formats will be supported in future updates.
